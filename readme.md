This directory contains the ready to use python scripts to find the sematic similarity for the query. 
Given a user query, these algorithms find the most similar documents to it, along with the similarity score for each document.

For this here I have implemented 2 NLP algorithms, all with widely used python NLP package - Gensim.

1. Latent Sematic Indexing (LSI)
2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
